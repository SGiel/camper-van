                    <h3>Our Van Story</h3>
                    <p>
                        After researching and obsessing over camper vans for 2 years, we finally 
                        decided to go for it when the pandemic hit in 2020. Jim found a van at a 
                        used car dealer in Canada that had been built out by <a href = "https://www.wildernessvans.com/" target="_blank">Wilderness Vans</a>.
                        It took about 3 months to get it over the border to Great Falls, Montana due to border 
                        closures. We finally went through a broker to formally import the van rather than 
                        wait until we could drive it across the border. Our first trip was a 4-day road trip starting 
                        in Great Falls, MT, then through Yellowstone National Park, the Grand Tetons,
                        Salt Lake City, UT, Las Vegas, NV and then home to Phoenix, AZ. Any doubts or 
                        hesitations about jumping into van life disappeared on that trip. We were hooked!

                    <p>
                        Our van is a 2018 Dodge Ram Promaster 3500, 159‚Äù ext. The build was wonderfully done by
                        <a href = "https://www.wildernessvans.com/" target="_blank">Wilderness Vans</a>. It was previously owned, 
                        so the bold (and we think super awesome) interior color and style choices are credited to the first owner. 
                        We have fully embraced living the orange life!
                    </p>  
                    <p>
                        Things we love about the van:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Solar panels that recharge the batteries so we can be off-grid.</li>
                        <li>Refrigerator and small freezer that keep food very cold (as long as battery charged).</li>
                        <li>Queen size bed with memory foam mattress.</li>
                        <li>Full size cassette toilet (that we haven't used much).</li>
                        <li>Large back garage with large slide-out shelf.</li>
                        <li>Great diesel heater (remember this van came from Canada).</li>
                        <li>Mid-cabin seating for two that converts to small bed.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 id="home-in-the-southwest">Home in the Southwest</h3>
                    <p>
                        We started immediately on our camper van adventures and discovered a couple of improvements we needed to make:
                    </p>  
                    <ol>
                        <li>We had gear we wanted to bring which required a roof-rack.</li>
                        <li>Camping in the Southwest definitely needs full on air-conditioning.</li>
                        <li>Full on air-conditioning required upgraded storage batteries.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                       We first added a roof-rack that Jim found through <a href="https://www.promasterforum.com/" target="_blank">promasterforum.com</a> from
                       <a href="https://www.commercialvan.com/san-diego.php" target="_blank">Commercial Van Interiors in San Diego, CA</a>.
                       Secondly, we started looking into adding the air conditioning which we knew was a big job. It required an upgrade from the dry cell
                       batteries we had to lithium batteries. We ended up taking our van to <a href="https://www.nomadiccooling.com/" target="_blank">Nomadic Cooling</a> in Phoenix,
                       and they installed new lithium batteries and a 12-volt rooftop airconditioner.
